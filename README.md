Phishing Email Analysis — Task 2

1. Email Metadata
- Subject: "Syllabus for the mid term"  
- Sender: Jaimol Thomas <a.jaimol@jaincollege.ac.in>  
- **Received via:** siimindia.com (suspicious intermediary domain)  
- **Date:** Sat, Sep 20, 3:08 PM  



 2. Observed Phishing Indicators
- ⚠️ The email was flagged as **SPAM by Gmail** ("This message is similar to messages that were identified as spam in the past").  
- ⚠️ **Sender domain mismatch**: Email claims to be from `jaincollege.ac.in` but was sent via `siimindia.com`.  
- ⚠️ **Unexpected attachment**: PDF file named `Document (4).pdf` with a **generic name** is suspicious.  
- ⚠️ **Generic body content**: Only states *"Syllabus of the mid term is attached below."* → lacks personalization and context.  



 3. Risks Identified
- The PDF attachment could contain malware, ransomware, or a phishing form.  
- The use of an **intermediary sending domain** (`siimindia.com`) increases risk of spoofing.  
- Lack of detailed/personalized content suggests a **mass phishing attempt**.  


 4. Recommended Actions
- 🚫 Do not open the attachment until it is verified with a tool such as **VirusTotal**.  
- ✅ Verify the sender by contacting **Jain College** through **official channels**.  
- 🚩 Report this email as **phishing** in Gmail or to your organization's security team.  
- 🗑️ If confirmed suspicious, **delete** the email immediately.  

 5. Conclusion
This email demonstrates several **phishing characteristics** including:
- **Domain mismatch**
- **Suspicious attachment**
- **Generic content**
- **Spam flag by Gmail**
 It should be treated as **potentially malicious** and handled with caution.
